The programs used for our School Project "streamverse", which was a website that displayed available content on different streaming sites.
This was accomplished by scraping a website which contained the relevant data, uploading it into our database, and then 
Uploading it to the WordPress site.

***The Programs containt here are:***
The server setup script - server_setup.sh
